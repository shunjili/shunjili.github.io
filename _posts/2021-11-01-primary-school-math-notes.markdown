## Geometry

* And similarly, triangles with the same height will have areas whose ratio is the same as the ratio of their bases. In the graph below

{: refdef}

$$\frac{S_{ABC}}{S_{ACD}} = \frac{BC}{CD}$$

* In a trapizoid below, you can have the following properties

{: refdef}

$$\frac{AO}{OC} = \frac{BO}{OD} = \frac{AB}{DC}$$

$$S_{AOD} = S_{BOC}$$


## Combinatorics

* The number of ways to choose $$n$$ items from $$m$$ items is 

$$\binom{m}{n} = \frac{m(m-1)(m-2)\dots(m-n+1)}{1\times 2 \times 3 \dots n}$$


## Number Theory

* Divisibility Rules
	- 2:  The last digit is an even number. 
	- 3: The sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
	- 4: The last two digit form a number that is divisible by 4. 
	- 5: The last digit is either a 5 or a 0 (zero).
	- 6: The number is divisible by BOTH 2 and 3
	- 7: You can double the last digit and subtract the sum from the rest of the number, and set an answer that is divisible by 7. 
	- 8: The last three digits from the a number that is divisible by 8.
	- 9: The sum of all the digits is divisible by 9.
